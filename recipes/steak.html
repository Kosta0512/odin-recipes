    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Flank steak is a lean cut of beef that comes from the cow's lower abdominal muscles. 
        It's a relatively tough cut that's low in fat, which means a few things: 
        Flank steak doesn't need to be trimmed, 
        it's inexpensive compared to other cuts, and it benefits greatly from marination.
